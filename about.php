            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p class="text-left">I’m a millennial but described as being an old soul. Yep, that’s right, a millennial with an old soul, what does that mean? Well, I prefer vinyl records over headphones, reading paper books versus reading them over an electronic device (not to mention my mini library), preferring to listen to the radio rather than watching Netflix, or latest shows on television, listen more to jazz and classical music than the latest pop album, and of course, have multiple notebooks of paper over multiple notes on my phone or papers typed on my computer. This doesn’t mean that I am anti-technology, it’d be incredibly hard to be a web designer and developer without a computer to work on, preferably a Macbook Pro.</p> 
            <p class="text-left">Growing up I was told by multiple people that I was not creative and the sad thing was I believed it. Many years of my life I walked around thinking I was not a creative person and never would be; however,  after a long personal and ongoing struggle of not thinking I was creative, my mindset changed and started to prove myself wrong. It turned out I was creative and the harder I worked at being creative the more creative I got. I discovered web design and development which is my biggest passion and best creative outlet. It’s a craft and put careful thought into each sketch, pixel, and line of code.</p>
            <p class="text-left">I taught myself how to code websites after taking a class online in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) shortly after moving down to Arizona in 2013 and from that a whole new world opened itself. Along the way were the usual struggles one would expect, working a full-time job, planning a  wedding, however after long nights the struggle paid off and after learning to code, design came next. I studied user interaction, user experience, and graphic design, there’s something about using a website or an app and realizing how beautiful the design is. The ease of how easy it is to use, that’s the craft that I try to make every time I work.</p>
            <p class="text-left">While I do love designing and developing, my other passions and expressions of creativity is photography, mostly photos of coffee shops, bookstores, nature and photos for mine and my wife’s blog. <a class="vnstyle" href="http://vandnstyle.co/" target="_blank">V&amp;N Style</a>. Fashion, another passion, reading fiction and nonfiction, writing short stories and journaling, and traveling to places we’ve never been. Let’s connect and create amazing things!</p>
