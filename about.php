              After graduating with two associate degrees from college, I decided to not to go back to school and instead 
              thought that I could do better at educating myself. In 2013, I moved down to Phoenix, Arizona 
              by myself, away from the only place I had ever lived in. Not long after moving to Arizona, my journey in 
              web design and development started as I taught myself how to create websites. Each and every night I 
              would study and practice the material. Whether it was for a couple minutes,  an hour or two, every day I 
              made the time possible. Reading as much material as I could on the subject, watching as many videos as I 
              could, and of course good ole paper and pen helped me to create my own personal projects. After learning 
              how to structure and build websites, I started venturing into design, specifically, my interests are graphic and 
              interaction design. It was there these two passions came forward merging with each other and now leads to 
              what I do now creating great looking websites and helping brands distinguish themselves from their respective 
              competition. My goal is to use the skills Iâ€™ve learned to help you move your business forward into this golden age of 
              technology. Using services like Wix and Squarespace are a great option. However, to put yourself above the rest 
              you'll need a custom designed website. I will work with you, find out your goals, who your audience is, and work 
              on implementing the best solution to drive more traffic.
