              My name is Nicholas Green. I am a self-taught web designer/developer that is currently living in Phoenix, Arizona. 
              Originally from Salt Lake City, Utah. However, at the age of 21, I sought out new scenery, adventure, and climate, 
              and moved down to the valley of the sun. My interest in web design and development grew after reading a book about 
              the subject. It had me staying up all night reading. After that, I became consumed by the matter, learning from 
              various resources when coming home from a full-time job. The main resource for learning was 
              <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/nicholasgreen" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>, learning from their videos, quizzes, and exercises.
              My passion has only grown. The more subjects studied, the more my interest is peaked in the vast world of web 
              design and development. While studying web design and development, Isites became more interested in design 
              and started creating side projects as a way for me to express my creativity.
