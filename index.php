                My name is Nicholas Green, and I am a freelance web designer living in Tucson, Arizona. I
                worked in the finance sector for a few years and graduated (insert college name here) with two
                associateâ€™s degrees. While working in the finance sector, I realized I wanted to find a job where
                I would be able to use my natural creativity every day, a job that I was passionate about. During
                my search I discovered web development and design, and I knew I had found the field I wanted
                to specialize in. After months of late night study sessions as well as more than my share of cups
                of coffee, I learned how to design and code websites. I filled notebook after notebook with
                ideas for designing desktop sites, as well as sites for tablets and mobile devices.
              </p>  
              <p class="text-left">
                When I am not developing or designing websites, I am usually out at my local coffee shop
                reading books, writing stories, and taking photographs of all sorts of things. I have also been
                helping my wife design and develop a fashion blog we run together, which you can check out at

              A collection of some websites that I designed and created. All the sites shown are responsive for mobile 
              and look great on any device. I list out what the project is about, who it resonates to. and the reason for 
              designing the site the way it is, mentioning as well the coding languages behind the site with a preview 
              of what the landing page looks like.

              My portfolio of projects that I have designed. All the projects listed mention what the project was, 
              such as a logo, print, website design (but not yet coded), etc. The project name is listed followed 
              by a short description of the project. The two programs that I use right now are Adobe Photoshop and Inkscape.
